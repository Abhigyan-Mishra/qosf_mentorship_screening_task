# QOSF Mentorship Screening Task Submission

## Task 4 - VQE

Here is the solution to Task 4 (*build from scratch VQE like circuits to find the lowest eigenvalue of a matrix*) in the form of a Jupyter Notebook.

First there is a more theoretical part discussing the main concepts of the algorithm, and subsequently its actual code implementation, properly commented and explained (at least I hope so ðŸ˜…). 

The quantum circuits are built using **Qiskit**. In addition, *Numpy* and *Scipy* are needed for the execution.

SPOILER: the minimum eigenvalue is -1.
